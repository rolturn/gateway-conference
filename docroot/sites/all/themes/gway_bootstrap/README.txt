We have purposely limited the scope of what can be controlled by this base theme to our reset and handling only things that we are standardized our procedures on such as CSS3 helpers or our base-grid system.

You thinking about editing this theme. Please don't. If you have suggestions on how to extend it or make it better let's talk. If you would like to use this theme as your base theme please see the README.txt file in the gway_starter folder.

Have a blessed day,
Roland
